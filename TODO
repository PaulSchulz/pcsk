Things needed to be done:

IMPORTANT:

* fix possible memory leaks
	- I know of none, it seems to be OK

* GNU-style long options
	- I can live without them, but not everybody

* man page
	- VERY important

* alternate logging style: do not close()/open() the logfile at every line,
  but instead accept a signal spec on the commandline, and reopen the
  logfile when that signal arrives (and do not deliver that signal to the
  child)
  	- if the program generates much output, the current practice is
	  not economical


EXTRAS:

* interface to achieve start-stop-daemon -like functionality
  (SIGKILL is still problematic) - a socket or sg like that

* environment cleanup (see start-stop-daemon, run, supervise)
