	* pcsk.c: changed the socket pairs from datagram syle communication to stream style communication (what a fool I was..:-)

2004-07-10		Norbert Buchmuller <norbi@nix.hu>
	* pcsk.c: fixed a bug with va_list (caused compilation error under gcc-3)

2004-07-09		Norbert Buchmuller <norbi@nix.hu>
	* *: renamed the program from runit to pcsk
	* *: swapped trunk and the 0.1 development branch (from now the development will always be on trunk, and stable releases are branches)


2004-05-12		Norbert Buchmuller <norbi@nix.hu>

	* pcsk.c: fixed a bug in persona (privilege) change code (now privilege change works)
	* pcsk.c: fixed a bug that made using option -U fail
	* pcsk.c: fixed a bug that caused segfault when using -u option

2004-04-23		Norbert Buchmuller <norbi@nix.hu>

	* pcsk.c: better handling of getgrouplist() (the old method worked, but was marginal)

2004-02-14		Norbert Buchmuller <norbi@nix.hu>

	* pcsk.c: fixed the bug causing an infinite loop (the bug was
	  introduced by the previous change)
	* pcsk.c: fixed a bug that caused hanging the interactive shell on
	  exit that started pcsk (now redirects stdin/stdout/stderr to
	  /dev/null early)

	  "Spawning ... (pid = x)" message
	* pcsk.c: fixed a bug that made the kill_grace stuff not to work

	* pcsk.c: new feature (option '-0'): don't respawn if the exit status
	  was 0 (true)
	* pcsk.c: new feature (option '-F'): don't respawn if the named file
	  exists (and unlinks the file on startup)
	* pcsk.c: minor changes in output format strings
	* pcsk.c: fixed a bug that caused pcsk to segfault when the pidfile
	  does not exist
	* pcsk.c: does not (erroneously) allow relative names in paths
	  (dir, logfile, pidfile, program)
	* pcsk.c: chdir to the root before checking any pidfiles, executables,
	  etc.
	* pcsk.c: different logit() format string before got daemonised


2003-09-13		Norbert Buchmuller <norbi@nix.hu>

	* pcsk.c: fixed a bug that might cause an infinite recursion when
	  the logfile was not a regular file
	* pcsk.c: now the child waits for the parent to log the spwaning
	  attempt (sock_sync)
	* pcsk.c: code cleanups


2003-07-27		Norbert Buchmuller <norbi@nix.hu>

	* pcsk.c: bugfixes, the previous version was seriously buggy
	* pcsk.c: one process again! (via sigsuspend(), can do IO and
	  wait()ing simulteaneously, without active waiting)

	* pcsk.c: bugfix in logging (collect_output())


2003-07-15		Norbert Buchmuller <norbertb@freemail.hu>

	* pcsk.c: fixed a bug in collect_input() (that corrupted logging
	  if the output came in small chunks)


2003-07-08		Norbert Buchmuller <norbertb@freemail.hu>

	* pcsk.c: can change uid/gid if needed
	* pcsk.c: logit() can be used everywhere (fprintf(stderr, ...)
	  is replaced)


2003-06-08		Norbert Buchmuller <norbertb@freemail.hu>

	* pcsk.c: change_persona() introduced
	* pcsk.c: fixed a bug that might cause an infinite recursion when
	  the logfile was not a regular file

	* pcsk.c: setting ps info in logger process works
	* pcsk.c: minor changes
	* pcsk.c: chroot capability


2003-03-12		Norbert Buchmuller <norbertb@freemail.hu>

	* pcsk.c: logging rewritten (forks into a separate logger process)


2003-02-02		Norbert Buchmuller <norbertb@freemail.hu>

	* pcsk.c: new operating mode (anticron), new concept: operating mode
	* pcsk.c: quiet logging option
	* pcsk.c: rewritten option parser (two phases), checks for
	  incompatible options
	* pcsk.c: pidfile deletion placed in the right place: cleanup code
	  ('twas a bug)
	* pcsk.c: minor code rearrangement (split up in functions)


2002-12-31		Norbert Buchmuller <norbertb@freemail.hu>

	* pcsk.c: check for a running pcsk process with the same pidfile
	* pcsk.c: remove pidfile after exiting
	* pcsk.c: -c0 option (never give up)
	* pcsk.c: checks for failed memory allocations
	* pcsk.c: corrected an error in child waiting (could be stuck in
	  select() if SIGCHLD arrives while not in select())
	* pcsk.c: restructured code (split up in separate functions)


2002-12-29		Norbert Buchmuller <norbertb@freemail.hu>

	* pcsk.c: added copyright notice :-)
	* pcsk.c: first (presumably) working version: collecting stderr/stdout
	  while waiting for the child to terminate (using SIGCHLD and select())
	* pcsk.c: experimental version (DOES NOT WORK!), with separate logger
	  child process

	* pcsk.c: fixes in open()..
	* pcsk.c: minor change in catch_signal()
	* pcsk.c: using only SIGTRAP for rotating logs
	* pcsk.c: good logfile handling: reopen logfile on each
	  non-terminating caught signal (HUP, USR1, USR2, WINCH, PWR)
	* pcsk.c: Changed logfile behaviour: re-opens logfile on every log
	  line (Rotating logs was not possible before.)
	* pcsk.c: added -v option (version info)
	* pcsk.c: added only the usage printout.. :-)


2002-08-29		Norbert Buchmuller <norbertb@freemail.hu>
