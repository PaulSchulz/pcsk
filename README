PCSK is a program that

* daemonises (cleanly), and then forks a program (which so does not need to
  do the dirty work itself)

* spawns a (non-daemonising) program, waits and re-spawns it if terminated
  (guarantees that it always runs), or

* runs a program at least every n seconds, but as often as possible
  ('anti-cron')

* can do a chroot before running a program

* can change uid/gid before running a program

* logs (with timestamp) the program starting/termination events, and optionally
  the program's stdout and/or stderr in a file


PCSK is written in C.

Systems
~~~~~~~

The program exensively takes use of GNU libc, and some not-so-common
I/O interfaces. It was written for a GNU/Linux system. No other ports
exist (yet?). Help is welcome, if you think that it should be ported. ;-)
