The compilation and installing is straightforward:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code

  2. Type 'make' to compile the package.

  3. Type 'make install' to install the program and other stuff.


Compilers
=========

Works with GCC 2.95.4. Perhaps with many others, no black magic involved. :-)


Installation Paths
==================

By default, installs the files under '/usr/local/bin', '/usr/local/man', etc.
You can override it with giving the DESTDIR=<somepath> for make, eg.:
make install DESTDIR=/opt/pcsk/
